# Convert PlantUML to diagrams.net XML

Transform your PlantUML diagrams into fully editable diagrams.net (formerly draw.io) files directly from your command line. This script is designed for software engineers like you who want to seamlessly integrate their documentation workflows.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Direct Conversion:** Convert your `.plantuml` files to `.drawio` XML format effortlessly.
- **Embedded Content:** The original PlantUML source code and the rendered SVG are embedded within the diagrams.net XML, allowing for easy access and editing.
- **Interactive Diagrams:** Double-click the converted diagram in diagrams.net to reveal and edit the PlantUML source. If the PlantUML library is loaded in diagrams.net, changes will update the diagram dynamically.
- **Command-Line Utility:** Integrate this script into your build processes or use it for quick, one-off conversions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can use this script, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java:** The script relies on the PlantUML JAR, which requires a Java Runtime Environment. Tested with OpenJDK 21 and Amazon Corretto 17.
- **Graphviz (for Linux users):** The `dot` command, part of the `graphviz` package, is necessary for rendering certain PlantUML diagrams. If you're on Linux, you can install it with:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install graphviz
  ```

- **diagrams.net / draw.io:** While not strictly required to _run_ the script, you'll need diagrams.net (desktop application or web) to open and interact with the generated XML files. Tested with diagrams.net ^24.3.1.

### Installation

[**Include instructions on how to obtain/install the script. Is it a single script? A compiled binary? A package? Add relevant commands here.**]

### Creating a PlantUML File

If you're new to PlantUML, here's a simple example to get you started. Save this code in a file named `cat-eats-mouse.plantuml`:

```plantuml
@startuml
Cat -> Mouse : eats
@enduml
```

### Converting to diagrams.net XML

Now, use the `plantuml-to-drawio` command to convert your PlantUML file. The output will be sent to standard output, so you can redirect it to a `.drawio` file:

```bash
plantuml-to-drawio cat-eats-mouse.plantuml > cat-eats-mouse.drawio
```

### Opening in diagrams.net

You have a couple of options for opening the generated `.drawio` file in diagrams.net:

- **Open as a new diagram:**

  1. In diagrams.net, go to `File` > `Open from` > `Device...`
  2. Select the `cat-eats-mouse.drawio` file.

- **Import into an existing diagram:**
  1. In diagrams.net, open your existing diagram.
  2. Go to `File` > `Import from` > `Device...`
  3. Select the `cat-eats-mouse.drawio` file.

## üõ† How it Works

This script performs a series of steps to achieve the conversion:

1. **PlantUML to SVG:** Utilizes the PlantUML JAR and Java to convert the plain text PlantUML code into an SVG image.
2. **SVG Encoding:** Encodes the generated SVG data using Base64 for embedding within the XML.
3. **PlantUML Text Encoding:** Encodes the original PlantUML text data to be safe for embedding in XML/HTML/URL formats.
4. **Dimension Extraction:** Parses the SVG data to extract its dimensions (width and height) for proper rendering in diagrams.net.
5. **Last Modified Date:** Retrieves the last modification date of the input PlantUML file to set as the revision date in the diagrams.net XML.
6. **XML Generation:** Constructs the diagrams.net XML file, embedding the encoded SVG and PlantUML text, and outputs it to standard output.

## üèó Building from Source

If you wish to build the executable binary from the source code, follow these steps:

1. Make the build script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x ./build.sh
   ```

2. Run the build script:

   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

   This will create a `dist` folder containing the compiled binary.
